# Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a comprehensive web analytics service that provides insights into website traffic, user behavior, and conversions. It allows you to track how users find your website, what they do on your site, and whether they complete desired actions (like making a purchase or filling out a form).&#x20;

Understanding Google Analytics data is crucial for optimizing your website, improving user experience, and driving business results.

### **How a Google Analytics Connection Works in Uniquery**

Uniquery streamlines the process of accessing and analyzing your Google Analytics data directly within Google Sheets. Instead of manually exporting reports from the Google Analytics interface, Uniquery establishes a secure, direct connection to the Google Analytics Data API (for Google Analytics 4) using OAuth 2.0 authentication. This connection allows you to:

* **Automate Data Retrieval:** Pull your Google Analytics data directly into your spreadsheets.
* **Customize Reports:** Select specific metrics and dimensions to build reports tailored to your needs.
* **Schedule Refreshes:** Keep your data up-to-date with automatic hourly, daily, or weekly refreshes.
* **Combine Data Sources:** Integrate Google Analytics data with data from other marketing platforms (like LinkedIn Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.) for a holistic view of your marketing performance. All in one spread sheet.
* Directly access the Google Analytics API and extract the response to Google Sheets.

### **Metrics**&#x20;

In Google Analytics, _metrics_ are the quantitative measurements of user activity on your website. They provide the numerical data that shows how users are interacting with your site.
