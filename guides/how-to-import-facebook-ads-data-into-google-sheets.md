### Authorizing Uniquery for Facebook Ads Data Import

Before importing any data, you need to authorize Uniquery to access your Facebook Ads account:

1. **Open Uniquery Sidebar**: In the sidebar of your spreadsheet, launch Uniquery.
2. **Link Your Facebook Account**: Navigate to Create > Manage Connections via the menu icon, click ‘Add Connection’, and select Facebook for linkage.
3. **Authorize Connection**: Follow the prompts, log in to your Facebook account, and authorize Uniquery to access your ad data.

**Importing Facebook Ads Data into Google Sheets**

Now that Uniquery is set up and authorized, you’re ready to import Facebook Ads data:

On the top Create menu, select “Create report”, and on the next page, select Facebook Ads. Now you can see the Facebook Ads report configuration page.

The first step of creating a Facebook Ads report is to select a date range for the report. In this example, we will select the date range of “Month to date,” meaning that the report will contain data from the first day of the current month to today.

Please remember whatever date you choose here will become relative. When the data refreshes in the next month, you will get the next month’s “Month to date” data.

The second step of creating a Facebook Ads report in Google Sheets involves selecting the reporting metrics and dimensions. This is important as it defines the type of data you’ll be analyzing and presenting in your report.

**Metrics**

Metrics refer to the quantitative measurements of your Facebook Ads performance. These are numerical data points that tell you how your campaigns are performing in terms of achieving your marketing objectives. Examples of metrics you might consider including in your report are:

* **Clicks**: The total number of clicks on your ads. It’s a direct indicator of how engaging your ads are.
* **Impressions**: The number of times your ads were on screen. This helps you understand the reach of your ads.
* **Spend**: The total amount of money spent on your ads during the selected date range. It’s crucial for tracking your advertising budget.
* **Conversions**: The number of times users took a desired action after clicking on your ad. This could range from making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or any other goal you’ve set.
* **Cost per Action (CPA)**: The average cost for each action (conversion) taken. This metric helps you evaluate the cost-effectiveness of your ads.

**Dimensions**

Dimensions, on the other hand, provide context to your metrics. They are the qualitative aspects of your data that help you segment and break down your metrics for deeper insights. Examples of dimensions to include in your Facebook Ads report might be:

* **Campaign**: Grouping metrics by campaign allows you to see which campaigns are performing best.
* **Ad Set**: Provides insights into which sets of ads within campaigns are driving performance.
* **Ad**: Breaks down performance to the individual ad level, showing which specific ads are most effective.
* **Demographics**: Including dimensions such as age, gender, or location, can help you understand who your ads are reaching and how different groups are responding.

By selecting a combination of metrics and dimensions, you can tailor your Facebook Ads report to provide a comprehensive analysis of your campaigns’ performance.

The key is to choose metrics and dimensions that align with your specific business goals and objectives, ensuring that the report you create in Google Sheets using Uniquery delivers actionable insights.

In the final step, you will be able to choose a metric that you want to sort the report by. You can choose a metric and sort the result by descending or ascending order.

### Preview and run report

Once you have configured your Facebook Ads report, you can preview it before importing data into Google Sheets.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the result doesn’t exactly look like the data you want, you can simply close the preview window and change configurations on the sidebar, and preview the result again, until you are happy with the data you get.

Once this is done, close the preview window and click “Run report”.

You will then be asked to choose a sheet(tab) and a cell to insert your data.

We recommend the following setup:

* Always use a standalone sheet(tab) for data imported.
* Always insert the data from the A1 cell of a blank sheet.

This setup will prevent your existing data from being overwritten by the imported data.

In this example, we created a sheet called “data-sheet” and chose the A1 cell in that sheet for the Facebook Ads data import.

**Scheduling Automatic Refreshes**

After creating the report in Google Sheets using Uniquery, you have the option to schedule the report for automatic refreshes. This feature ensures that your report always contains the most up-to-date data without requiring manual updates. You can set up the report to refresh on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, depending on your needs and how frequently your data changes.

If your data requires constant monitoring, you may opt for hourly refreshes. For reports that track longer-term trends, daily or weekly refreshes might be more appropriate.

Once you have selected your preferred frequency, confirm your choice, and the system will automatically take care of the rest. Your report will refresh at the interval you’ve selected, ensuring that every time you access your report, you’re looking at the most current data available.

Remember to consider the volume of data being processed and the potential impact on performance when choosing your refresh frequency. In some cases, less frequent refreshes (such as daily or weekly) may be more suitable to avoid system overload, especially for reports that aggregate large amounts of data.
