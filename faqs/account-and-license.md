### 1. **Can I Change the Email Address Associated with My Uniquery License?**

Yes, you can change the email address associated with your Uniquery license. If you initially signed up with one email address but need to access your account through another email, we can assist you with the transition.

First, you'll need to create a new account using your desired email address. To do this, simply visit our website at [https://app.uniquery.io/](https://app.uniquery.io/) and log in using Google with your new email address. Once you have created the new account, please reply to us with a confirmation that the new account has been set up.

After we've received confirmation of your new account, we will proceed to migrate your license to the new email address. This process ensures that you can seamlessly continue to access and utilize Uniquery for all your reporting needs under your professional email.
