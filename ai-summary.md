#### **Enable AI Summary Option**:

You will find an option labeled "Send AI Summary of your data." Check this box to enable the AI summary feature.

#### **Select AI Service Connection**:

After enabling the AI summary option, a dropdown will appear labeled "Select AI service connection." Choose the appropriate AI service connection from this dropdown. This connection should be pre-configured with the necessary OAuth credentials for the AI service (e.g., OpenAI).

#### **Customize the AI Prompt (Optional)**:

There is an optional field labeled "Custom prompt (Optional)" where you can enter additional instructions or context for the AI. This helps in generating a more relevant and tailored summary. The prompt you enter here will be added to the default prompt set up for summarization.

#### **Append AI Summary to Imported Data**:

You will see a checkbox labeled "Append AI summary to imported data." Check this box if you want the generated summary to be appended directly to the imported data in your Google Sheet.
