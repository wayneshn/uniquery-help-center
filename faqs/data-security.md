# Data security

### Does Uniquery store my imported data on its servers?

No, Uniquery does not store your imported data on its servers. All your data is stored directly in your Google Sheets. We prioritize your data privacy and security, ensuring that none of the imported data is stored on our servers. By keeping your data within your Google Sheets, you have full control over your information and can manage it as you see fit. No other parties, including Uniquery, can view your imported data without your permission.

Uniquery acts as a conduit, facilitating the seamless transfer of data from various sources directly into your Google Sheets. This method minimizes the risk of data exposure or unauthorized access since your data does not pass through or reside on third-party servers. By leveraging the security infrastructure of Google Sheets, you can be confident that your data is protected by Google's robust security measures.

### **How Does Uniquery Handle My Account Connections, API Keys, and Credentials?**

Uniquery securely stores your account connections, API keys, and credentials within your Google account. We utilize [Google Sheets' user property storage](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties) feature to keep this information safe. This means that your credentials are stored "locally" within your Google account, and we do not have access to them. Only you can access and use these credentials, ensuring that your sensitive information remains protected and private.

This approach provides an additional layer of security, as your credentials do not leave your Google account and cannot be accessed by anyone else, **including Uniquery**.

### **FAQ: Is My Data Secure When Using Uniquery?**

Yes, your data is secure when using Uniquery. We do not store any of your imported data on our servers; it is all kept within your Google Sheets. Additionally, your account connections, API keys, and credentials are stored securely in your Google account using Google Sheets' user property storage feature.&#x20;

This approach ensures that only you have access to your credentials and that your data remains safe and private. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data security and privacy for our users.

### What Happens to My Data If I Stop Using Uniquery?

If you decide to stop using Uniquery, your data remains secure and under your control in your Google Sheets. Since Uniquery does not store any of your imported data on its servers, all your data will continue to reside in your Google Sheets. This means that you retain full ownership and control over your data, and it will not be affected by your decision to discontinue using Uniquery.

Your account connections, API keys, and credentials will be deleted from your Google Sheets and no one else will be able to access them.
