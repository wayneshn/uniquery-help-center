### Does Uniquery store my imported data on its servers?

No, Uniquery does not store your imported data on its servers. All your data is stored directly in your Google Sheets. We prioritize your data privacy and security, ensuring that none of the imported data is stored on our servers. By keeping your data within your Google Sheets, you have full control over your information and can manage it as you see fit.

### **How Does Uniquery Handle My Account Connections, API Keys, and Credentials?**

Uniquery securely stores your account connections, API keys, and credentials within your Google account. We utilize [Google Sheets' user property storage](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties) feature to keep this information safe. This means that your credentials are stored "locally" within your Google account, and we do not have access to them. Only you can access and use these credentials, ensuring that your sensitive information remains protected and private.
