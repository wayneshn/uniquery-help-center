# LinkedIn Ads

LinkedIn Ads is a powerful platform for B2B marketing, allowing you to target professionals based on their industry, job title, company, seniority, and more. It offers a variety of ad formats, including Sponsored Content, Message Ads (formerly Sponsored InMail), Text Ads, and Dynamic Ads, enabling you to reach your target audience with tailored messaging. Effective LinkedIn Ads campaigns rely on careful targeting, compelling creative, and consistent performance monitoring.

### **How a LinkedIn Ads Connection Works in Uniquery**

Uniquery simplifies the process of retrieving and analyzing your LinkedIn Ads data directly within Google Sheets. Instead of manually downloading CSV reports from the LinkedIn Campaign Manager, Uniquery establishes a secure, direct connection to the LinkedIn Ads API using OAuth 2.0 authentication. This connection allows you to:

* **Automate Data Retrieval:** Pull your LinkedIn Ads performance data directly into your spreadsheets.
* **Customize Reports:** Select specific metrics and dimensions to build reports tailored to your needs.
* **Schedule Refreshes:** Keep your data up-to-date with automatic hourly, daily, or weekly refreshes.
* **Combine Data Sources:** Integrate LinkedIn Ads data with data from other marketing platforms (like Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, etc.) for a holistic view of your marketing performance. All in one spreadsheet.
* Directly access the LinkedIn Ads API and extract the response to Google Sheets.

### **Metrics**

In LinkedIn Ads, _metrics_ represent the quantitative measurements of your campaign performance. They provide the numerical data that shows how your ads are performing. Understanding these metrics is crucial for evaluating the success of your campaigns and making data-driven optimizations.&#x20;
